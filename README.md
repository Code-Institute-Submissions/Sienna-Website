# Project Overview
This is my first milestone project as part of the Full Stack Development diploma for The Code Institute.

My younger sister has been working on her photography portfolio for the last couple of years and has recently had some amazing opportunities,
which has led to an impressive body of work.

Up until now she has been using various social media platforms to promote and contact clients. Which has been making it difficult to keep track of potential and current bookings.
I saw this as a good opportunity to create a simple, clearly structured and eye catching site to further promote Sienna's work and to make it easier for potential clients to reach her.

The owner of the site still has to complete some of the projects that need to be added to the site, therefore it will be made to an MVP standard and if and when contents need to be added it can be.

## Design
### Colour Scheme

<img src="assets/img/design/colour-palette.png"/>

For the colour palette I wanted to pick colours that sat well with all the imagery used on the site and that didn't draw the users attention away from the photography too much.
I noticed that on all of my Sister's photos there is this nice orange hue that slightly comes through. After a little playing around with what I thought was nice we both came to choose 
[#EFA484] which was used as little splashes of colour thoughout the site, being used on various headings and on links when hovered over. 

[#969696] Was used on the navigation bars located at the bottom of each of the section. These were originally the orange colour but I felt that I could improve the contrast ratio so I opted for the grey.

[#0A0A0A] Was used on the sections largest headings. Simple, bold and eye catching but doesn't obstruct any of the imagery. The [#FFFFFF] was then used as the inverse headings for the sections with the orange background.
This was to keep the site interesting on the eyes as you scrolled down the page.

### Typography

- The font used in the main bodies of text and text blocks was Google Fonts 'Aileron' with a weight of 100, styles of lowercase and uppercase, with sans-serif used as a fallback font. 
Simple easy to read and was a great match with the fonts used on the landing page and headings.

<img src="assets/img/design/text-block.png" height="30px"/>

- All large headings used Google Fonts 'Abril-Fatface' also with sans-serif as a fallback font. For the landing page I used an italicised version and for each sections 
main heading I used regular with a weight of 400. This was to continue with the theme of the landing page.

<img src="assets/img/design/main-title.png" height="30px"/><img src="assets/img/design/section-title.png" height="30px"/>

- For the contact page and sub headings uppercase 'Aileron' was used because it's really clear and easy to read. It was also a nice match with the other fonts and font styles used across the site.

<img src="assets/img/design/contact-type.png" height="30px"/><img src="assets/img/design/sub-type.png" height="30px"/>

## Skeleton

all the way down the site. As well as it being a design idea it also informs the user what the site is about.

the site is about.

### Changes since original wireframes

- I opted for a top navigation bar on the landing page as oposed to the originally planned bottom nav bar, I felt it sat better with the hero image used and didn't obstruct the view of it as much.
- The hamburger dropdown menu is now transparent background in the top right.
- The contact form doesn't have a bottom nav but now has a back to top button.

# Technologies Used
### Languages Used

-  [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

-  [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)

### Programs & Frameworks used

[Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/)

- Google fonts, Abril-Fatface, Aileron and serif were used throughout the project with sans-serif set as the backup. All linked in the head of the project to increase loading times.

[Bootstrap 4.0.0:](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/)

- Bootstrap was used for the navigation bar and throughout to help with the responsiveness.

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

- Font Awesome was used for the social icons in the contact form and the downwards chevron on the homepage.

 [jQuery:](https://jquery.com/)

- jQuery was used for the navbar toogler and dropdown menu.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/)

- Git was used for version control by utilizing the CLI to push and commit to GitHub.

[GitHub:](https://github.com/)

- GitHub used to store the code.

[AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html)

- Adobe XD was used to produce the wireframes and Mockups for the project.

[Jpeg Optimizer](http://www.jpeg-optimizer.com/)

- I used this jpeg optimizer to compress all the imagery to help with performance results.

# Testing 

### Code validation

Checking for any Syntax errors was done using the W3C HTML5 and CSS3 validators.

-  [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org) - <img src="assets/img/testing/html-result.png">
This warning was expected as I purposly didn't include a heading. 

-  [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - <img src="assets/img/testing/css-result.png">

### Lighthouse in dev tools

Both mobile and desktop tests came back with high scores. Some improvements can be made to the performance which was expected with such an image heavy site. I used http://www.jpeg-optimizer.com/ to compress the images
to a point where the image quality wasn't lost too much. A possible future solution to the performance could be to include a loading page when the site starts up so the user isn't looking at a half loaded page.

Responsiveness was also tested extensively in the dev tools, on multiple device types.

### Functionality Testing
- #### Navigation bar
    - All links are working and have been tested on multiple browsers and devices.
    - All links collapse and the hamburger nav appears on screen sizes 992px or smaller.

    - Image column count collapses from three to two between 768px and 480px to increase image size. Cross browser testing was done.
    - Image column count collapses to one on screens at 480px and smaller.
- #### Fixed typography 
    - Sideways type remained in a fixed positon while scrolling through the site without interfering with any links or imagery.
    - Colour changes whilst scrolling through different colour pages to keep the contrast ratios up.
- #### Contact form
    - Required message popped up when a field was left unfilled. 
    - GET method was completed with no 405 error

---

### Cross Browser Testing

My mentor suggested to me that I may experience some browser compatibility issues with some of the CSS rules I used for the sideways typography. This was the case, I will explain how they 
affect the browsers I tested individually.

#### Google Chrome
- Mobile - All working as expected
- Tablet - All working as expected
- Desktop - All working as expected
#### Opera 
- Mobile - All working as expected
- Tablet - All working as expected
- Desktop - All working as expected
#### Microsoft Edge 
- Mobile - All working as expected
- Tablet - All working as expected
- Desktop - All working as expected
#### Firefox
- Mobile - Functionality and layout working as expected but the ```mix-blend-mode``` changes the text to blue [#105B7B] as opposed to the expected orange [#EFA484] when scrolling through sections with a white background. 
- Tablet - Same result as mobile and desktop
- Desktop - Same result as tablet and mobile.
#### Safari
- Mobile - The layout was affected in this browser as well as the colour change mentioned previously. Both headings were pushed over to one side of the browser.
I struggled to find a solution for this one.
- Tablet - Same result as mobile and desktop 
- Desktop - Same result as mobile and tablet.

### Known Bugs

- On Safari browser the ```.left-heading``` and ```.right-heading``` are both pushed over to one side of the browser and the ```mix-blend-mode: exclusion;``` has a different colour than expected when passing through sections with a white 
background.

- On the contact page when the viewport height overlaps the form it cuts the bottom off. Had a difficult time figuring out what the cause was.
