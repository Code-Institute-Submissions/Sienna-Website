# Project Overview
This is my first milestone project as part of the Full Stack Development diploma for The Code Institute.

My younger sister has been working on her photography portfolio for the last couple of years and has recently had some amazing opportunities,
which has led to an impressive body of work.

Up until now she has been using various social media platforms to promote and contact clients. Which has been making it difficult to keep track of potential and current bookings.
I saw this as a good opportunity to create a simple, clearly structured and eye catching site to further promote Sienna's work and to make it easier for potential clients to reach her.

# UX

## Strategy
The Strategy of Sienna's personal site is to increase the amount of potential bookings and people viewing her work. Futhermore to increase the amount of people contacting her.

## Scope
The sites main role is promote work within a creative industry so it will need to be eye catching, user friendly and with a well designed layout that suites the target audience of Sienna's work. 
The owner of the site still has to complete some of the projects that need to be added to the site, therefore it will be made to an MVP standard and if and when contents need to be added it can be.
